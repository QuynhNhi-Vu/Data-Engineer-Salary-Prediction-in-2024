# Data Engineer Salary Prediction in 2024
This project analyzes data engineer salaries and employment attributes for 2024. The dataset provides insights into salary trends, experience levels, employment types, and geographic variations in compensation. By applying data analysis and predictive modeling, the project aims to understand key factors affecting salaries and forecast potential salary trends for data engineering roles.

***About Dataset***

This dataset provides insights into data engineer salaries and employment attributes for the year 2024. It includes information such as salary, job title, experience level, employment type, employee residence, remote work ratio, company location, and company size.

The dataset allows for analysis of salary trends, employment patterns, and geographic variations in data engineering roles. It can be used by researchers, analysts, and organizations to understand the evolving landscape of data engineering employment and compensation.
